I'm a 1st year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at the Polytechnic University 👨‍🎓. I enjoy working with different technologies and exploring various fields, as well as learning new things 👾. Currently, I'm developing simple programs and implementing various data structures, which helps me understand their inner workings and principles of operation 💻.
